<h1 style="background-color:SlateBlue;">Fake Happy</h1>
<p style="background-color:Orange;">I love making you believe
What you get is what you see
But I'm so fake happy
I feel so fake happy
And I bet everybody here
Is just as insincere
We're all so fake happy
And I know fake happy
I been doing a good job of makin' 'em think
I'm quite alright
But I hope I don't blink
You see its easy when I'm stomping on a beat
But no one sees me when I crawl back underneath
If I smile with my teeth
Bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me
Oh please don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh what's the use
Oh please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too.
